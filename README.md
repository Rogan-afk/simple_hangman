# simple_hangman
This basic hangman game was made as a part of a tutorial on lists. it is a great way to get acquainted with loops, basic ascii art and lists.  
all you need  to understand about this basic toy project are concepts of loops(definite and indefinite), lists, the random module and basic string methods.

run on replit to ensure that clear() works each time or if using on vscode or similar editors, import a similar package and clear screen each time after a guess.
